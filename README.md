# Kinzoku
i like the metal pipe falling meme and in japanese "metal pipe" is "kinzoku paipu" so i took "Kinzoku" as the name of the project

### what is this?
a small project i need to do for school. this should be a mental arithmetic trainer

### how to use?
all you need installed is python 3  
`python kinzoku.py` for the CLI version  
`python kinzoku.py -g` for the GUI version  
`python kinzoku.py -e` to use easy mode  
`python kinzoku.py -h` for more help  

### what else?
the program is currently in german, maybe i will translate it someday
